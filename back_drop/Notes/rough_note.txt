What I still need from you (quick)

Confirm: keep no online payment for now (only COD), or also add basic Razorpay/Stripe later? (We can keep code paths ready: payment_method="ONLINE" creates order with status="paid" after callback.)

Do you want supplier webhooks later, or manual admin fulfillment is enough for phase 1?

Once you paste the snippets above and run migrations/tests, backend core is complete for a dropshipping MVP with COD, supplier ownership, cancel/ship, emails, docs, and tests. Then we jump to the Angular screens.
