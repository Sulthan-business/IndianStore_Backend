🪴 P3 — “Nice later” (still free, but not urgent)
These are more about polishing and adding depth:

Recently viewed products

Store a list of recently viewed product IDs per user (session or DB).

Simple analytics endpoints

/analytics/sales-by-day/ and /analytics/sales-by-product/ returning JSON.

Idempotent checkout

Prevent accidental double orders if a user clicks checkout twice.

Order status transitions & history

Track changes like Pending → Paid → Shipped → Delivered, with timestamps.

Lightweight backups

A script or cron job to dump the DB to a safe location daily/weekly.
